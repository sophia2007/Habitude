# Habitude
ISC4U Summative - Human Habits and Productivity Simulator

**Concept:**
A simulation that models the impact of daily habits on a person's long-term productivity and well-being. Users input a schedule or set of routines (e.g., sleep, work, exercise, relaxation), and the simulation shows how those routines affect outcomes like efficiency, happiness, and health over time.
**Objective:**
To maintain the physic and mental health bars while lowering the work bar. The work bar increase weekly and decrease every work period by an amount dependent on productivity. 
- Win: If the war bar is worked down to 0 at the end of 3 consecutive weeks.
- Loose: If the work bar this week and next week overfills the progress bar, a timer of 7 days start counting down for the user to lower the work bar back down. If the user can not, they loose.
