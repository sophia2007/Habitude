# Habitude
ISC4U Summative - Human Habits and Productivity Simulator

**Concept:**
A simulation that models the impact of daily habits on a person's long-term productivity and well-being. Users input a schedule or set of routines (e.g., sleep, work, exercise, relaxation), and the simulation shows how those routines affect outcomes like efficiency, happiness, and health over time.

**Objective:**
To maintain the physical and mental health of the character while lowering the workload progress bar. The workload bar increase weekly and decrease every assigned work period by an amount dependent on productivity. 
- Win: If the workload bar is worked down to 0 at the end of 3 consecutive weeks.
- Loose: If the workload bar this week and next week overfills the progress bar, a timer of 7 days start counting down for the user to lower the work bar back down. If the user can not, they loose.
